                <h2>Quotes that inspire me:</h2>
                <img src="/ui/point.gif"/>Steve Jobs - Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.  <br>
                <img src="/ui/point.gif"/>Steve Jobs - Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people.  <br>
                <img src="/ui/point.gif"/>Bill Gates - It's fine to celebrate success but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure<br>
                <img src="/ui/point.gif"/>Bill Gates - Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose.
